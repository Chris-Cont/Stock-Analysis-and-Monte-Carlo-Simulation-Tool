# Stock-Analysis-and-Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Tool
This code is a comprehensive Python script that uses the yfinance library to retrieve stock data, analyze financial metrics, and perform risk analysis through Monte Carlo simulations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main components:

# Data Retrieval and Stock Metrics:

The script pulls stock price history and financial data (like market capitalization, debt, and cash) from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.
The calculate_metrics_accurate() function handles the calculation of enterprise value (EV) and equity value, factoring in market cap, cash, and total debt. It uses a flexible approach to handle different balance sheet terminologies.

# Volatility and Earnings Per Share (EPS):

The calculate_eps_and_volatility() function computes daily volatility based on the adjusted closing price or close price. EPS is approximated by dividing the stock price by an assumed number of shares outstanding.
Volatility is expressed as the percentage change in price on a day-to-day basis, which helps in analyzing stock fluctuations.

# Backtesting and Performance Statistics:

The calculate_backtesting_and_stats() function computes daily returns, cumulative returns, and key statistical measures like maximum gain/loss, standard deviation, and the fifth worst loss.
It provides a backtest on historical stock data, showing how an investment would have performed over the selected time frame.

# Monte Carlo Simulation:

The monte_carlo_simulation() function simulates possible future stock prices based on historical returns. It uses log-normal returns and calculates future prices across a user-defined number of intervals and simulations.
It computes confidence intervals (e.g., 1-sigma, 2-sigma), providing potential price ranges with corresponding probabilities.

# Data Visualization:

The script includes several plots, such as adjusted closing price, cumulative returns, and day-to-day volatility.
A histogram is generated to display the distribution of volatility and the Value at Risk (VaR) at various confidence levels.
Monte Carlo simulation results are visualized, and a histogram of final simulated stock prices is presented.

# User Interaction:

The user is prompted to enter a stock ticker, start date, investment amount, and parameters for the Monte Carlo simulation (e.g., time intervals and number of simulations).
The script is designed to guide the user through the process, including allowing them to select a specific interval to highlight in the Monte Carlo output.

# Potential Improvements:
Error Handling: There is minimal error handling, particularly around user input, data retrieval, and financial metrics that might not always be available. Adding try-except blocks would improve robustness.
Dynamic Shares Outstanding: The EPS calculation assumes 1,000,000 shares outstanding. It would be better to fetch this value dynamically from financial data if available.
Performance: Monte Carlo simulation with thousands of iterations might be computationally heavy. Consider optimizing or offering a lower default for simulations.
Documentation: The code would benefit from more inline comments, especially for explaining complex parts like the Monte Carlo logic.


**Overall, the code is well-structured and provides a solid framework for financial data analysis, but could be enhanced with additional features and optimizations.**

# Example:
Enter the ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL): AAPL

Enter the start date (mm/dd/yyyy): 01/01/2020

Enter the investment amount (e.g., 10000): 10000

Enter the number of time intervals (days) for Monte Carlo simulation: 250

Enter the number of simulations for Monte Carlo simulation: 10000
