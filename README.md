Stock Analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation Tool

This Python script is a comprehensive tool that leverages the yfinance library to retrieve stock data, analyze financial metrics, and conduct risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulations. Below is a breakdown of the main components:

# Data Retrieval and Stock Metrics:

The script pulls stock price history and financial data (like market capitalization, debt, and cash) from Yahoo Finance using yfinance. The calculate_metrics_accurate() function calculates the enterprise value (EV) and equity value, factoring in market cap, cash, and total debt. It is designed to handle various balance sheet terminologies.

# Volatility and Earnings Per Share (EPS):

The calculate_eps_and_volatility() function computes daily volatility based on the adjusted closing price or close price. EPS is estimated by dividing the stock price by an assumed number of shares outstanding. Volatility is expressed as the percentage change in price on a day-to-day basis, which helps in analyzing stock fluctuations.

# Backtesting and Performance Statistics:

The calculate_backtesting_and_stats() function computes daily returns, cumulative returns, and key statistical measures like maximum gain/loss, standard deviation, and the fifth-worst loss. It provides a backtest on historical stock data, showing how an investment would have performed over the selected time frame.

# Monte Carlo Simulation:

The monte_carlo_simulation() function simulates potential future stock prices based on historical returns. It uses log-normal returns and projects future prices across user-defined time intervals and simulations. Confidence intervals (e.g., 1-sigma, 2-sigma) are calculated, providing a range of potential price outcomes with associated probabilities.

# Data Visualization:

Several plots are included to visualize adjusted closing price, cumulative returns, and daily volatility. A histogram displays the distribution of volatility and the Value at Risk (VaR) at various confidence levels. The Monte Carlo simulation results are visualized with a histogram of final simulated stock prices.

# User Interaction:

The script prompts the user for input such as stock ticker, start date, investment amount, and Monte Carlo simulation parameters (time intervals and number of simulations). It guides the user through the process, allowing them to select a specific interval to highlight in the Monte Carlo output.

# Potential Improvements:

-Error Handling: The script currently has minimal error handling, particularly for user input, data retrieval, and missing financial metrics. Adding try-except blocks would enhance robustness.
-Dynamic Shares Outstanding (Implemented): The EPS calculation now dynamically fetches the actual number of shares outstanding from Yahoo Finance. If this information is unavailable, it defaults to 1,000,000 shares, ensuring a more accurate EPS calculation. Further improvements could include  better error handling if shares outstanding are missing.
-Performance: Running Monte Carlo simulations with thousands of iterations can be computationally expensive. Consider optimizing or offering a lower default for simulations.
-Documentation: Adding more inline comments, especially around complex sections like the Monte Carlo simulation, would improve code readability and maintainability.

# Example:

Enter the ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL): AAPL 

Enter the start date (mm/dd/yyyy): 01/01/2020 

Enter the investment amount (e.g., 10000): 10000 

Enter the number of time intervals (days) for Monte Carlo simulation: 250 

Enter the number of simulations for Monte Carlo simulation: 10000
